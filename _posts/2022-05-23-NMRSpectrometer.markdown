This project was my capstone project for my engineering degree. In it, my group and I built an NMR spectrometer. This is a device similar to an MRI machine except it does not measure spatial information. This was a challenging but rewarding project. The project is detailed in a modified version of our final report which is embedded below.

Throughout the design process I took on the role of designing, assembling, and testing the hardware, which included the circuitry and coils. In addition, I wrote the numerical simulator code, the signal processing code, and contributed to the control electronics code. Finally, I was responsible for conducting the experimental trials.
