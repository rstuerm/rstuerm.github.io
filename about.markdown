I am a graduate student completing a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the University of Alberta where I am studying quantum computers. In particular, I am studying the initialization of spin-qubits through quantum transport simulations.

This website serves as a work-in-progress portfolio of some select projects that I have worked on in my spare time. I may also add an occasional less-technical guide. I aim to include pages for additional projects as I find the time.
